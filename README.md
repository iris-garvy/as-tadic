Calculating the a-number using T-adic methods

The T-adic method, titled cartier-tadic, is based off of theory from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13966) by Jeremy Booher, Bryden Cais, Joe Kramer-Miller, James Upton.

The p-adic methods, titled cartier-schmidt, are ported from this paper by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14819) by Matthew Schmidt. It was originally in Julia, so I just translated it to Magma.
